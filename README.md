# 👋 Hi, I’m Avyakt Rout

I’m a **Computer Science student at Cal State Fullerton (Class of 2026)** focused on building **distributed backend systems and AI-powered applications**.

I’m especially interested in:

- Distributed systems & microservice architectures  
- Memory-augmented AI systems  
- Benchmark-driven model evaluation  
- Secure backend APIs  
- Cloud-native deployment  

I enjoy taking ideas from architecture → implementation → deployment, with an emphasis on reliability, scalability, and clean system design.
